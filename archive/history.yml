- - What is the theory of evolution?
  - The theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for the diversity of life on Earth. It proposes that species gradually change and diversify over time through a process called natural selection. This theory, first formulated by Charles Darwin in the mid-19th century, revolutionized our understanding of biology and has since become the foundation of modern evolutionary biology. According to the theory, individuals within a population possess variations, and those with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their traits to future generations. Over time, these accumulated changes can lead to the development of new species. The theory of evolution provides a framework for understanding the unity and diversity of life, the relationships between different organisms, and the processes that have shaped the natural world. It is supported by a vast array of evidence from various fields, including genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy.
