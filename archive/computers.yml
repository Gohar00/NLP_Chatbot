- - What is blockchain?
  - Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes in a secure and transparent manner.
  - It allows for the creation of a tamper-proof and immutable record of transactions, eliminating the need for a central authority or intermediary.
  - Each transaction, or block, is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks, hence the name blockchain.
  - Blockchain technology provides transparency, security, and trust in various applications, including cryptocurrency transactions (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), supply chain management, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps).
  - The decentralized nature of blockchain makes it resistant to manipulation or censorship, and it enables peer-to-peer interactions without relying on a central entity.
  - The potential of blockchain extends beyond finance, with exploration in areas like healthcare, voting systems, intellectual property rights, and decentralized identity management.

- - What was the first computer?
  - It's hard to say, but the ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
  - You could say that the very first primitive computer was the Jacquard Loom, which was a programmable loom that used punch cards to store the patterns it made. This made it a reprogrammable mechanical device.
  - The Manchester Mark 1, developed at the University of Manchester in 1948, is also considered one of the earliest stored-program computers.
  - The Colossus, a series of computers developed by British codebreakers during World War II, was used to decrypt encrypted German messages.
